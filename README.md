This is the crustal shear wave velocity model around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis (EHS).
Please refer to 

	Hu, S., and H. Yao (2018), Crustal velocity structure around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis: Implications for the nucleation mechanism of the 2017 Ms 6.9 Mainling earthquake and regional tectonics, Tectonophysics, 744, 1-9

for detailed description of the model.

Model file format (for every line):

longitude latitude depth velocity flag

flag = 1 means the velocity is relatively reliable at the corresponding (lon, lat);
flag = 0 means the velocity cannot be constrained by the data at this point.
